### Hello, future Alex.

To get going, run `jekyll serve` in your terminal. That should take care of everything you need.

Dependency managament: no gemfile, sorry (you should probably do that if you have the time, future Alex). For now, I think you have to make sure [compass-style.org](Compass) is installed (`gem install compass`).

For CSS, reference [https://github.com/dropbox/css-style-guide](Dropbox's CSS styleguide).

That's about all ... for now.
