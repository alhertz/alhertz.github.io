On designing in browser
==========

A couple of weeks ago, I was asked to give a talk at [Front End Party](http://frontendparty.com) and because I was working on a project being designed entirely in the browser, I figured it only would make sense to go over some of my thoughts on how designers can be more productive when it comes to designing for this digital medium. 

The first time I designed something in browser was about six months ago and ever since then I now know that **mocking something up can very often be a huge waste of time.** 

I'm not saying that we should stop mocking things up all together. Mockups do have the ability serve as an incredibly valuable communication tool but that's about it. The days of pixel perfect execution from PSD to HTML/CSS/JS are numbered and we as designers should begin to start re-assessing our workflow. Scratch that, lets reasses web design. How you gonna say you're a web designer yet not know that something like frontend frameworks exist?

All I am trying to get across is this question: Is web design really perfectly stylized elements in a PSD? Or is that only one cavet? In my opinion, web designers design systems for solving problems related to experience, aesthetic, [device sizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_displays_by_pixel_density), and performance.
