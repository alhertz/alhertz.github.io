On designing in browser 
==========

A couple of weeks ago, I was asked to give a talk at [Front End Party](http://frontendparty.com) ([here's a link to the deck I was working with](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19527741/party.pdf)) and because I was working on a project being designed entirely in the browser at the time, I figured it only would make sense to go over some of my thoughts on just that. 

The first time I designed something in browser was about six months ago and ever since then I now know **mocking something up can very often be a huge waste of time.** 

I'm not saying that we should stop mocking things up all together. Mockups do have the ability to serve as an incredibly valuable communication tool but sometimes it may make more sense to go straight from a sketch to your text editor. The days of pixel perfect execution from PSD to HTML/CSS/JS are over and we as designers should begin re-assessing our workflow.

Is being able to create perfectly stylized elements in a PSD what being a web designer is? Or is that only one cavet? In my opinion, web designers design systems for solving problems related to experience, aesthetic, [device sizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_displays_by_pixel_density), and performance.
