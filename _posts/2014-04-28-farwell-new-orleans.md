Farewell New Orleans 
==========

After five amazing years of living in New Orleans I will be leaving this fair city next month. I have recently accepted an offer from [Gumroad](https://www.gumroad.com) to become their new Product Designer and couldn't be more excited. They are helping creatives make a living online in a big way and I cannot wait begin to contribute. 

This is most certainly a bittersweet goodbye and is coming somewhat unexpectedly but it is time to explore San Francisco and the tech culture there. I cannot thank enough all the wonderful friends & co-workers I have met here over the past years for their support and general awesome-ness. I wouldn't be who I am today without you all. 

> As of May 10th, I will be no longer be a resident of New Orleans, LA and will be on my way to San Francisco. If you're in town and want to catchup before then, [shoot me an email](mailto:hey@hey.al)! 

If you have never heard of [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) I encourage you to check it out! Additionally if you're a creator, I would also love any thoughts on how Gumroad could possibly be better for you.
