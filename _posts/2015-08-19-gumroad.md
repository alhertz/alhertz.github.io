## Creator Onboarding

When I joined Gumroad, the product's feature set was growing significantly beyond just ["a way to ask folks to pay for downloads"](http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/14/gumroad-lets-you-sell-anything-you-make/) and it was evident that we needed  to create an onboarding experience that would drive usage of core features, engagement with educational content, and enable the rolling out of infrastructural changes that improve the payments experience.

### Greeters

Depending on where creators were in their journey with using Gumroad, greeters would either help point them in the right direction, explain a feature, or collect information needed for us to do things on behalf of the creator.

1. Expose educational content and campaigns
2. Collect necessary information for Stripe Connect
3. Drive core feature engagement (publish a product, make a sale, add a username, gain a follow)

### 1. The welcome greeter
