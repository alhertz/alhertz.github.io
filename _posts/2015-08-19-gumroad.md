## Creator Onboarding

When I joined Gumroad, the product's feature set was growing significantly beyond just ["a way to ask folks to pay for downloads"](http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/14/gumroad-lets-you-sell-anything-you-make/) and it was evident that we needed to create an onboarding experience that would drive usage of core features and enable us to roll out of infrastructural changes that were going to improve payments for Gumroad.

### Enter Greeters

To begin creating an onboarding experience that satisfied these objectives, I designed a system of functional "Greeters".

    <div class="browser">
      <div class="bar">
        <span></span>
        <span></span>
        <span></span>

      <h3>The Welcome Greeter</h3>
      <p>As the first greeter seen by new creators after creating an account, after the fields within are completed begin processing payments on the creators behalf and know more about the experience level and type of goods being sold so we could better curate their onboarding experience throughout their journey using the product.</p>

    <p>After doing some general task based interactions with the app, we were able to immediately began doing some light hand holding to expose some real value for our creators with the dashboard greeter.</p>

### 3. The Product and Profile Greeters

This greeter is the first thing seen by new creators signing up for Gumroad after creating an account. Using the information collected here, we're able to begin processing payments on the creators behalf and know more about the experience level and type of goods being sold so we could better curate their onboarding experience throughout their journey using the product.
