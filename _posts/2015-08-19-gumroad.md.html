    <h2>Onboarding new <span>users</span> <span class="line-break--desktop"></span> Creators</h2>
    <p>Since it's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2406614">inception in 2011</a>, Gumroad's <a href="https://gumroad.com/features">feature set</a> had grown extensively beyond <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/14/gumroad-lets-you-sell-anything-you-make/">"a way to ask folks to pay for downloads"</a> and in early 2015 we began exposing more of the awesome things we had built for our creators. One of the ways this was accomplished, was via a system of interstitial views designed by myself and built in collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/amiruci">@amiruci</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/shl">@shl</a> aptly named "Greeters". From gathering information, to generating understanding and excitement for a given feature, Greeters were a simple &amp; straight-forward method for making new creators more successful, faster. Here's a look at what that experience was like.</p>

      <p>Should a new Gumroad creator be ready to start selling their work the moment they sign up, they'll quickly end up at the product greeter where, for the first time, they're able to add a product to sell on Gumroad. At this point, we're also able include links to <a href="https://help.gumroad.com/11162-Getting-Started/adding-a-product">pertinent help center content</a> for new creators less sure of how to proceed creating their first product.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, if a new creator is not ready to publish their first product but wants to start taking the necessary steps towards making a living online and build their audience, they'll end up at the Profile Greeter. It's here that they'll be able to choose a username and learn about the value of having an online presence to begin with. As a result of shipping this greeter, we saw a 17% increase in profiles created by new creators within their first week after sign up.</p>

      <h3>Payout Greeter</h3>
      <p>In this greeter, we gather the info needed to get creators paid. It was important to us that we direct creators to this greeter after a they had made a few sales so we could show real <strong>quantifiable</strong> value before forcing the creator to hand over some pretty sensitive information. Because of this decision, we were able to establish a great deal of trust from the creator in Gumroad, which made providing things like Social Security Number &amp; Date of Birth a less ominous experience.</p>

    <h2>Growing an audience with Gumroad</h2>
    <p>Gumroad since it's begining has been an excellent e-commerce tool for those that already have an audience but for those who don't, our creators were largely left to their own devices. Begining in July of 2015, I worked on a suite of improvements designed to make profiles simple, high-converting pages where new creators could collect email addresses while they worked on their publishing their first product on Gumroad, and in turn, make their first dollar using the service.</p>

      <p>A Gumroad profile with no products is the seed that starts a creative career.

      <h3>Profile customization</h3>
      <p>Leaving as little to the imagination as possible, all profile customizations happen inline. From connecting social media accounts to tweaking a profile's colors and copy, personalization is exposed in the form of Popovers that enable creators to make their profiles unique expression of themselves.</p>

      <p>In order to get functionality live and at the finger-tips of creators quickly, each popover went live individually. This was my intention from the outset and is the reason why the interface for customization is so modular. Not only did this simplify the engineering process by isolating complexity, but it also gave us an opportunity to segment <a href="http://blog.gumroad.com/post/127251975678/videobackgrounds">promotional efforts</a>. Doing this gave us the ability to measure engagement and awareness around a given feature with a higher degree of granularity.</p>
