  <p>Since it's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2406614">inception in 2011</a>, Gumroad's <a href="https://gumroad.com/features">feature set</a> had grown extensively beyond <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/14/gumroad-lets-you-sell-anything-you-make/">"a way to ask folks to pay for downloads"</a> and in early 2015 we began exposing more of the awesome things we had built for the ever-diversifying needs of new creators signing up. To accomplish this, I built a system of interstitial views designed to guide new creators through their first experience using Gumroad while exposing pertinent features and educational content all along the way.</p>

        <p>As the first greeter seen by new creators after creating an account, the information collected here, most importantly, allows us to begin processing payments. After completing these three fields, a creator is free to publish products and start making sales immediately.</p>

      <h3>Dashboard Greeter</h3>
      <p>Once the fields in the Welcome Greeter are completed, we're able to immediately began doing some light hand holding to expose some real value for our creators with the dashboard greeter. Here, new creators are shown two possible paths with a recommendation on which to choose depending on whether or not they have experience selling things online.</p>

      <h3>Product Greeter</h3>
      <p>Should a new Gumroad creator be ready to start selling their work the moment they sign up, they'll quickly end up at the product greeter where, for the first time, they're shown the interface used for product creation. This is the first time new creators are shown the UI they'll continue to interact with for the remainder of their lifespan using the product. </p>

      <h3>Profile Greeter</h3>
      <p>Alternatively, if a new creator is not ready to publish their first product but wants to start taking the necessary steps towards making a living online and build their audience, they'll end up at the Profile Greeter. It's here that they'll be able to choose a username and learn about the value of having an online presence to begin with. As a result of shipping this greeter, we saw a 17% increase in profiles created by new creators within their first week after sign up.</p>

      <h3>Payout Greeter</h3>
      <p>In this greeter, we gather the info needed to get creators paid. It was important to us that we direct creators to this greeter after a they had made a few sales so we could show real <strong>quantifiable</strong> value before forcing the creator to hand over sensitive information. This allowed us to establish a great deal of trust from the creator in Gumroad which made providing things like Social Security Number &amp; Date of Birth a less ominous experience.</p>
