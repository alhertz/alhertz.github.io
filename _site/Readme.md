### Hello, future Alex.

First, make sure you have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) installed.

```
gem install jekyll
```

Then, run `jekyll serve` in your terminal.

Dependency managament: no gemfile, sorry (you should probably do that if you have the time, future Alex). For now, just make sure [compass-style.org](Compass) is installed (`gem install compass`). That _should_ be it.
