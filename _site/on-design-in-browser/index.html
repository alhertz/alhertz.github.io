        <h1>On designing in browser</h1>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I was asked to give a talk at <a href="http://frontendparty.com">Front End Party</a> and because I was working on a project being designed entirely in the browser at the time, I figured it only would make sense to go over some of my thoughts on just that. </p>

<p>The first time I designed something in browser was about six months ago and ever since then I now know <strong>mocking something up can very often be a huge waste of time.</strong> </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that we should stop mocking things up all together. Mockups do have the ability serve as an incredibly valuable communication tool but that&#39;s about it. The days of pixel perfect execution from PSD to HTML/CSS/JS are over and we as designers should begin re-assessing our workflow.</p>

<p>What I am trying to get across is this question: Is being able to create perfectly stylized elements in a PSD what being a web designer is? Or is that only one cavet? In my opinion, web designers design systems for solving problems related to experience, aesthetic, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_displays_by_pixel_density">device sizes</a>, and performance.</p>
