<p>It&#39;s the little things that very often produce the best results. That being said, here are some super usefull snippets for mobile Apple devices you may want to make sure you&#39;re using if you aren&#39;t already when building web applications.</p>

<h2>Remove Toolbars</h2>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;apple-mobile-web-app-capable&quot;</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">&quot;yes&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Change the status bar color</h2>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style&quot;</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">&quot;black&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Touch Icon </h2>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;apple-touch-icon&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;img/app-icon.png&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Splash Screen Image</h2>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;apple-touch-startup-image&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;img/splash-screen.png&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
These get a lot more verbose but for simplicitys sake, I&#39;ve included the code a bit abridged. If you want a good example of these snippets en masse, <a href="https://gist.github.com/tfausak/2222823">check out this epic gist</a> by Taylor Fausak. </p>
