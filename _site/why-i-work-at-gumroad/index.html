<p>When I decided to move to San Francisco from New Orleans to work at Gumroad as a Product Designer, some people wanted to know why. </p>

<p>This was a fair question but it made me realize that not enough people know why the hell I do what I do.

<h3>Early Years</h3>

<p>Since I was quite young I have wanted to make music. That and be a cartoonist. While my third-grade classmates dreamed of being firemen, doctors, &amp; police officers I geared up for a long fruitful life of hardcore doodling and shredding (you have no idea how many times I have drawn a Fender Stratocaster on my binder with a bic pen).
By the time I was in middle school, I had picked up the guitar and had become decent enough to start a band just before entering high school.</p>

<p>Throughout every band I was in, I was convinced that we would hit it big and that people just needed to hear us. We used to call random phone numbers from the basement we practiced in and when a human picked up, we played our hearts out. Looking back, it was hilarious but at the time, it seemed like a pretty good strategy. </p>

<p>As you might imagine, I realized pretty quickly that if I was going to be a rock star, playing guitar through the telephone wouldn&#39;t be enough. Having a bit of a knack for drawing and a copy of Photoshop on the computer at my Dad&#39;s townhouse, off I was making posters, stickers, and stencils on the weekends that we would visit. If there was some way for me get the word out about my band through art, I was all over it. Eventually I went from an aspiring rock star &amp; cartoonist, to an aspiring rockstar and <em>designer</em>. A small change with big implications.</p>

<h3>College</h3>

<p>When I got into design, I didn&#39;t do it because I necessarily wanted to. I did it because it was necessary to better promote the art I deeply cared about. But as word got out that I had a bit of a knack for it I started doing it for my friends&#39; bands too. Eventually, friends of friends&#39; came calling and ultimately, people I had never met before. By the time I was in college, I was working as a freelance designer exclusively for musicians while I got a degree in music industry studies in New Orleans. Things were going pretty well.</p>

<p>Everything I learned about design whether it be for web or print I would apply to my band at the time <a href="http://wwww.sunhotelsounds.com">Sun Hotel</a>. All we ever wanted to do was to be able to pay the rent with our music and in a short while I became intimately familiar how hard that was to do independently. </p>

<h3>After College</h3>

<p>As time pressed on, I was still playing but I began to focus more on being behind the scenes and less on the stage. Along with some friends, I started a <a href="http://www.chinquapinrecords.com">musicians co-op</a> (now dormant) focused on sharing the music we made and the music we loved. We released about 20 or so records and/or compilations, threw a ton of events, and helped a lot of awesome bands from out of state play in New Orleans to a new crowd and get heard. It was incredibly empowering and enjoyable for me to try and help other musicians and artists I cared about.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, a few more years had passed and I began to dedicate even more time to working behind the scenes. I was still playing in Sun Hotel but I had found that working to improve the digital world for artists through design and code was something I was very passionate about and somewhat good at. When Gumroad came calling, it made sense to see what difference I could make building a product focused on the same thing I have been focused on much of my life.</p>

<p>I care deeply about music and even more so about the people who try and make a living doing it independently. To be able to find a balance between creativity and commerce is an incredibly hard, noisy, and exhausting experience. I truly feel that Gumroad is on the way to making things much easier for not only musicians, but creatives in general. Excited to help make sure it continues to happen.</p>
