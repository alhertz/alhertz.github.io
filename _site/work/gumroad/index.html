<p>Since it&#39;s <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2406614">inception in 2011</a>, Gumroad&#39;s <a href="https://gumroad.com/features">feature set</a> has grown significantly beyond just <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/14/gumroad-lets-you-sell-anything-you-make/">&quot;a way to ask folks to pay for downloads&quot;</a> and in early 2015 we began exposing more of the awesome things we had built for the ever-diversifying needs of new creators signing up. To accomplish this, I built a system of interstitial views designed to guide new creators through their first experience using Gumroad while exposing pertinent features and educational content all along the way.</p>

      <h3>Welcome Greeter</h3>
      <p>As the first greeter seen by new creators after creating an account, the information collected here, most importantly, allows us to begin processing payments. After completing these three fields, a creator is free to publish products and start making sales immediately.</p>

    <h3>Dashboard Greeter</h3>
    <p>Once the fields in the Welcome Greeter are completed, we're able to immediately began doing some light hand holding to expose some real value for our creators with the dashboard greeter. Here, new creators are shown two possible paths with a recommendation on which to choose depending on whether or not they have experience selling things online.</p>

    <h3>Product Greeter</h3>
    <p>Should a new Gumroad creator be ready to start selling their work the moment they sign up, they'll quickly end up at the product greeter where, for the first time, they're shown the interface used for product creation. This is the first time new creators are shown the UI they'll continue to interact with for the remainder of their lifespan using the product. </p>

    <h3>Profile Greeter</h3>
    <p>Alternatively, if a new creator is not ready to publish their first product but wants to start taking the necessary steps towards making a living online and build their audience, they'll end up at the Profile Greeter. It's here that they'll be able to choose a username and learn about the value of having an online presence to begin with. As a result of shipping this greeter, we saw a 17% increase in profiles created by new creators within their first week after sign up.</p>

    <h3>Payout Greeter</h3>
    <p>The last greeter to be shipped was the payout greeter. Here we gather a great deal of sensitive information from the creator in order to pay them for the sales they have (likely) made. It was important to us that we ask for this information after a creator has published a product  unlike other e-commerce services. Things like Social Security Number and Date of Birth are precious possesions and I didn't want to take the retrieval of them lightly. It's also worth noting that this UI changes to suit the requirements for <a href="http://blog.gumroad.com/post/131028510598/canadian-payouts">Canadian</a> and Australian payouts</p>
