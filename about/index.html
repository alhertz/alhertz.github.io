    <div class="eight columns biography">
      <p>Born in Baltimore, raised in Philadelphia, and educated in New Orleans, I'm a designer focused on helping technology be a better companion to creativity.</p>

      <p>Recently, I lead design at <a href="http://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a>, a company designing a better commerce experience for the creative economy. During my time there, we had the honor of being featured as the #2 company in Fast Company’s “<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3041644/most-innovative-companies-2015/the-worlds-top-10-most-innovative-companies-of-2015-in-design">World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies of 2015 in Design</a>” for making e-commerce as painless as tweeting.</p>

      <p>Before that, I collaborated with friend &amp; fellow designer <a href="http://leemartin.com">Lee Martin</a> in creating unique digital experiences that helped musicians engage their fans in a manner that honored their art and story. We also scaled that service with <a href="suite.fm">Suite</a>, a set of simple marketing apps for bands and record labels.</p>

      <p>When not working, you can usually find me exploring the bay area, practicing yoga, or playing guitar.</p>
