<h1>About</h1>

<p>My name is Alex Hertz but feel free to call me Al. I design and develop the part of the internet you see and interact with. I'm always trying to find new ways to make the internet a more exciting place for music.</p>

<p id="biography-continued"><img src="/img/hey-there.jpg" alt="Alex Hertz"></p>

<p>My specialties lie in user experience and interface design but I do quite a bit of front-end development as well. I strive to keep my work simple and intuitive and address every project from the standpoint that good design solves problems. That, and by the time I'm done, I want users to say to say, "of-course that's how it works." Even if they didn't know it before.</p>

<p>Over the past six or so years I have primarily worked as a freelance designer but have cut my teeth into advertising, and application design as well. Today, I work in the music industry helping artist connect with their listeners better through design and code.</p>
