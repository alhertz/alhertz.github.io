<h3>Hey.</h3>

<p>My name is Alex Hertz but feel free to call me Al. I design and develop the part of the internet you see and interact with. My main focus is to provide simple, intuitive and attractive solutions to problems.</p>

<p>Over the past six or so years I have primarily worked as a freelance designer but have cut my teeth into advertising, and software development as well. Today, I work in the music industry helping artist connect with their listeners better through design and code.</p>
