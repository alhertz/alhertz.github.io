      <h1>Hey, I’m Al.</h1>

      <p class="first">I’m a designer based in San Francisco dedicated to building useful technology for creative people.</p>

      <p>Currently, I’m helping define how the next generation of financial technology is built as a designer at <a href="https://plaid.com">Plaid</a>.</p>

      <p>Previously, I led design at <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a>, a company designing a better commerce experience for the creative economy. During my time there, we had the honor of being featured as the #2 company in Fast Company’s “<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3041644/most-innovative-companies-2015/the-worlds-top-10-most-innovative-companies-of-2015-in-design">World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies of 2015 in Design</a>” for making e-commerce as painless as tweeting.</p>

      <p>When not working, I can usually be found exploring the Bay Area, practicing yoga, or making music.</p>
