Hey.

My name is Alex Hertz but feel free to call me Al. I design and develop the part of the internet you see and interact with. My main focus is to provide simple, intuitive and attractive solutions to problems.

Over the past six or so years I have primarily worked as a freelance designer but have cut my teeth into advertising, and software development as well. Today, I work in the music industry helping artist connect with their listeners better through design and code.
